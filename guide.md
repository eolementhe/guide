  <summary><b>Good practices for collaborate in a workflow.</b></summary>

If you want to create collaborative workflows. Some good practices must be respected.

The easiest way is to use the pause block. At each pause all users in email recipient will have access to the file generated from the previous block. 

Thus all user in recipient will receive an email giving them access to the file generated from the previous block. In addition, they will see the workflow in the monitoring view and edit the file in library file. They will also be able to continue or stop the workflow in monitoring view. 

Let's take a simple example: 

A user starts a translation workflow. However, several translators must access the file in order to be able to correct it. We create the following workflow: 

![workflow-collaborative-subtitle](images/workflow-collaborative-subtitle.png)

Once the workflow is paused. Users in recipient email of the pause block receive the file from previous block (here a speech to text block). So they will just have to correct the subtitles file `.srt`. Once the corrections have been made, one of the users will simply have to continue the pause and the workflow will resume its execution with the corrected subtitle file.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How to organize my file by folder?</b></summary>

In the `ingest` and `delivery` block you can see a `Destination folder` field that allows you to organize these files with folders.

The `Destination folder` field of the Ingest block allows you to redirect all source files to the folder tree you specified. 

The `Destination folder` field of the Delivery block allows you to redirect all generated files to the folder tree you specified. 

If you leave the fields empty as below: 

![workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty](images/workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty.png)

All your source and generated files will be sent to the root of your file server eolementhe.

![workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty-result](images/workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty-result.png)

If you specify the field `Destination folder` you will be able to classify your files simply. 

Example : 

![workflow-editor-ingest-destination-complete](images/workflow-editor-ingest-destination-complete.png)

Here we redirect all the source files to the `eole` folder, which is in the `test` folder. And we redirect all the generated files to the `loudness` folder which is in the `test` folder.

Result in the `File Library`:
