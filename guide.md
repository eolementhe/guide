At first we will create a new metadata form model.

Select `Create a new model`.
![manage-metadata-2](images/manage-metadata-2.png)

Enter the name of your new model metadata form (here `Example_metadata_form`git ).

![manage-metadata-3](images/manage-metadata-3.png)

There are 3 different categories of fields that you can add to Eolementhe.

The `Label` fields allowing to add strings of characters. 

The `Datepicker` fields allowing you to add a date.

The `Dropdown` fields allow you to add a custom drop-down list.

We will add a `Label` field in our example. We  fill the information in our field (label, placeholder, default value, optional). 
![manage-metadata-4](images/manage-metadata-4.png)

To add the field you just filled in to the model click on `add select`.

![manage-metadata-5](images/manage-metadata-5.png)

The field is now added to the model, and the form preview appears at the bottom of the pop-up window. 

This part allows you to have a preview of the final form before validation. 

![manage-metadata-6](images/manage-metadata-6.png)

We will add a `Dropdown` field in our example. We  fill the information in our field (name, options list, optional). 

![manage-metadata-7](images/manage-metadata-7.png)

To add the field click on `add select` again.

![manage-metadata-5](images/manage-metadata-5.png)

![manage-metadata-8](images/manage-metadata-8.png)

<hr>

We will now modify the metadata model that we have just added. 

Select your  metadata model in the select. 

![manage-metadata-9](images/manage-metadata-9.png)

When you select an existing metadata model, the preview of the form appears directly at the bottom of the pop-up window. 

![manage-metadata-10](images/manage-metadata-10.png)

If you want to delete a field you have to click on the black cross icon:

If you want to modify a field, there are several steps to perform.

First you must click on the magnifying glass icon of the field you want to modify:

![manage-metadata-12](images/manage-metadata-12.png)

Then we can see that as the image below that our field was loaded in the part `Add or modify field`.

![manage-metadata-14](images/manage-metadata-14.png)

Modify the information of your choice. 

To finish updating our field, click on `Update label`;

![manage-metadata-15](images/manage-metadata-15.png)

We can see that our field was modified. (In this example we have modified the placeholder).

<details>
  <summary><b>How to notify someone?</b></summary>
  

You can notify the status of your workflow to other users with the recipient email feature. 

Recipient email appears in `Pause` and `Delivery` block. 

![workflow-recipient-email](images/workflow-recipient-email.png)

The  recipient email allows users added to have the same follow-up as the owner of the workflows (monitoring, notifications, email ...). 

Your own email address is automatically added in the recipient email list.

 You can search all users on the platform and if the user doesn't exist you can add him by writing his email address in the search bar and pressing `Enter`.
 You can also add more than one at a time. It is enough to separate the email addresses by `;`
  You can suppress an existing email from list by clicking in the red trash button.

<details>
  <summary><b>Good practices for collaborative workflow.</b></summary>

If you want to create collaborative workflow, some good practices must be respected.

The easiest way is to use the `Pause block`. At each pause all users in the email recipient list will have access to the file generated from the previous block. 

Thus all users in recipient list will receive an email giving them access to the file generated from the previous block. In addition, they will see the workflow in the monitoring view and  will be allow to edit the file library . They will also be able to continue or stop the workflow in the monitoring view. 

Let's take a simple example: 

A user starts a translation workflow. However, several translators must access to the file in order to be able to modify it. We create the following workflow: 

![workflow-collaborative-subtitle](images/workflow-collaborative-subtitle.png)

Once the workflow is paused, users in the recipient email list will be notified by email. They will receive the link to connect to the `File library` and to check the result of the previous block (here a Speech to text block). In this example they will just have to modify the subtitles file `.srt`. Once the modification have been made, one of the user can simply  click on `Validate file and continue workflow`to make the workflow continue or click on `Stop workflow for this file` to abort the execution of the workflow (in `File library`on the file paused). 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How to organize my file by folder?</b></summary>

In the `ingest` and `delivery` block you can see a `Destination folder` field that allows you to organize these files with folders.

The `Destination folder` field of the Ingest block allows you to redirect all source files to the folder/subfolder you specify. 

The `Destination folder` field of the Delivery block allows you to redirect all generated files to the folder/subfolder you specify. 

If you leave the fields empty as below: 

![workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty](images/workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty.png)

All your sources and generated files will be sent to the root of your Eolementhe file server.

![workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty-result](images/workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-empty-result.png)

If you specify the field `Destination folder` you will be able to classify your files simply. 

Example : 

![workflow-editor-ingest-destination-complete](images/workflow-editor-ingest-destination-complete.png)

Here we redirect all the source files to the `origin` folder, which is in the `test` folder. And we redirect all the generated files to the `loudness` folder which is also in the `test` folder.

Result in the `File Library`: 

![workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-complete-result](images/workflow-editor-ingest-delivery-destination-complete-result.png)

  <summary><b>How to create FTP watchfolder?</b></summary>

An FTP WatchFolder allows you to specify a folder on an external FTP server. When adding files to this folder all the files added will be taken as source files and launched by Eolementhe in a workflow of your choice.
